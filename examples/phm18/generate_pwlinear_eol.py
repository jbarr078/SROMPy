'''
Script to generate piecewise linear SROM approximation to EOL and compare it 
with the Monte Carlo solution - step 3. Uses the stored EOL model outputs 
from step 2 and the stored input SROM from step 1. In LINEAR case, need to
estimate gradients with finite difference. To do so, the model was run with
perturbed values of the inputs and the resulting EOLs were stored in the files
named "srom_fd_eol_m<>.txt".
